# Passive-dynamic-walker
Tad McGeer introduced a class of walking robots, known as passive dynamic walkers, which walk stably down a small decline without the use of any motors. The most impressive passive dynamic walker  has knees and arms, and walks with a surprisingly anthropomorphic gait. These machines provide an elegant illustration of how proper machine design can generate stable and potentially very energy efficient walking.
